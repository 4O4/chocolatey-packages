    <summary>SSHFS For Windows</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[SSHFS-Win is a minimal port of [SSHFS](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) to Windows. Under the hood it uses [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com) for the POSIX environment and [WinFsp](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp) for the FUSE functionality.

Check out the Github project page for full description and instructions - [SSHFS For Windows](https://github.com/billziss-gh/sshfs-win/)

## Basic Usage

Once you have installed WinFsp and SSHFS-Win you can map a network drive to a directory on an SSHFS host using Windows Explorer or the `net use` command.

### Windows Explorer

In Windows Explorer select This PC > Map Network Drive and enter the desired drive letter and SSHFS path using the following UNC syntax:

    \\sshfs\REMUSER@HOST[\PATH]

The first time you map a particular SSHFS path you will be prompted for the SSHFS username and password. You may choose to save these credentials with the Windows Credential Manager in which case you will not be prompted again.

In order to unmap the drive, right-click on the drive icon in Windows Explorer and select Disconnect.


### Command Line

You can map a network drive from the command line using the `net use` command:

```
> net use X: \\sshfs\billziss@mac2018.local
The password is invalid for \\sshfs\billziss@mac2018.local.

Enter the user name for 'sshfs': billziss
Enter the password for sshfs:
The command completed successfully.
```

You can list your `net use` drives:

```
$ net use
New connections will be remembered.


Status       Local     Remote                    Network

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
             X:        \\sshfs\billziss@mac2018.local
                                                WinFsp.Np
The command completed successfully.
```

Finally you can unmap the drive as follows:

```
$ net use X: /delete
X: was deleted successfully.
```

## UNC Syntax

The complete UNC syntax is as follows:

    \\sshfs\[LOCUSER=]REMUSER@HOST[!PORT][\PATH]
    \\sshfs.r\[LOCUSER=]REMUSER@HOST[!PORT][\PATH]
    \\sshfs.k\[LOCUSER=]REMUSER@HOST[!PORT][\PATH]

- `REMUSER` is the remote user (i.e. the user on the SSHFS host whose credentials are being used for access).
- `HOST` is the SSHFS host.
- `PORT` is the remote port on the SSHFS host (optional; default is 22).
- `PATH` is the remote path. This is interpreted as follows:
    - The `sshfs` prefix maps to `HOST:~REMUSER/PATH` on the SSHFS host (i.e. relative to `REMUSER`'s home directory).
    - The `sshfs.r` prefix maps to `HOST:/PATH` on the SSHFS host (i.e. relative to the `HOST`'s root directory).
    - The `sshfs.k` prefix maps to `HOST:~REMUSER/PATH` and uses the ssh key in `%USERPROFILE%/.ssh/id_rsa` (where `%USERPROFILE%` is the home directory of the local Windows user).
- `LOCUSER` is the local Windows user (optional; `USERNAME` or `DOMAIN+USERNAME` format).
    - Please note that this functionality is rarely necessary with latest versions of WinFsp.
